# Create an empty string using the String class and assign it to a variable.

word = String.new("")

# LS answer:
# empty_string = String.new
# Discussion
# In Ruby, strings can be created in multiple ways. Empty strings, however, can only be created in two ways. In the solution, we use one of the two ways, which is invoking String's ::new class method. The second way involves the use of a string literal, like so:

# empty_string = ''
# Ruby interprets string literals as String objects. Therefore, '' and String::new accomplish the same task because they both return an empty string object.
