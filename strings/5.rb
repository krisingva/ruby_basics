# Combining Names
# Using the following code, combine the two names together to form a full name and assign that value to a variable named full_name. Then, print the value of full_name.

# first_name = 'John'
# last_name = 'Doe'
# Expected output:

# John Doe

first_name = 'John'
last_name = 'Doe'

puts full_name = "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

# Can you think of at least two additional ways to combine a first and last name into a full name?

# puts full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

# puts full_name = last_name.prepend(first_name, " ")

# puts full_name = first_name.concat(" ", last_name)
