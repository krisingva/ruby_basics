# Write a method named print_me that prints "I'm printing within the method!" when invoked.

def print_me
  puts "I'm printing within the method!"
end 

print_me

# using puts inside a method will output whatever it is given and return nil
# if puts is removed from the method, we will print out the return value of the method which will be the string "I'm printing within the method!"

# def print_me
#   "I'm printing within the method!"
# end
