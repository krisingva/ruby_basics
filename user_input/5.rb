# Write a program that prints 'Launch School is the best!' repeatedly until a certain number of lines have been printed. The program should obtain the number of lines from the user, and should insist that at least 3 lines are printed.

# For now, just use #to_i to convert the input value to an Integer, and check that result instead of trying to insist on a valid number; validation of numeric input is a topic with a fair number of edge conditions that are beyond the scope of this exercise.

  count = gets.chomp.to_i
  if count < 3
    puts ">> Please enter 3 or more"
  else
    count.times { puts "Launch School is the best!" }
